This is a poster presentation talk targeting prospective PhD students --- posters at the venue generally were about the research being done by various labs and PhD students in the department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder. The topic of my poster is deriving hardness of approximation results for the covering radius problem in lattices under various L-p norms. At this poster session, I was awarded a "Best Work in Progress" poster presentation award.
