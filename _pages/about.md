# About me
I am a PhD Student in the [department of Computer Science at the University of Colorado - Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/cs/) and its [Theory of Computation Group](https://www.colorado.edu/cs-theory/), advised by [Huck Bennett](https://home.cs.colorado.edu/~hbennett/). My primary interests are generally in the realm of theoretical computer science, with a focus on approximation algorithms and hardness of approximation. Recently, I have been working on lattice problems.

# About this site
This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [Academic Pages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the repository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV.
