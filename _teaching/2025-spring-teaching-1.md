I was a teaching assistant for the University of Colorado, Boulder introduction to algorithms course targeting undergraduates in the computer science major.

Course Overview
======
The course is an introduction to typical paradigms of algorithm design and standard techniques of algorithm correctness and analysis. A small component of the course is dedicated to a discussion of basic complexity classes. 

A brief listing of covered topics:
* Asymptotic analysis
* Basic graph algorithms
* Basic greedy algorithms
* Basic divide and conquer algorithms
* Basic dynamic programming algorithms
* Hash tables
* Amortized analysis
* The complexity classes P and NP
